        <h1>This is about me!</h1>
        <p> I am a Physical Therapist Assistant. I also have a degree in Biology for funzies.
          I attended a front-end boot camp at <a href="#" class="up">Upstream Coding.</a> Where, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          I decided to learn web development in order to add a new challenge in my life. Learning and growing has always been a priority in my life.</p>

        <h2>What do I do for fun?</h2>
        <p>Besides learning web development I have a number of hobbies. </p>

        <h3>Roller Derby </h3>
        <p>That is right, I said Roller Derby!<p>
        <p>I began my roller derby career in Troy Pennsylvania. I moved to a random town (where I did not know anyone) for a job. One of my co-worker turned out to be on a new roller derby team!
          I said "Sign me up for that!" My derby persona (Dead-Leigh) was born and I never looked back. After, moving back to Pittsurgh, I played a couple years with Steel City Roller Derby. At Steel City I was promoted from Blocker to Jammer. I was the girl with the star!
          I transferred to Little Steel Roller Girls(Located in Youngtown, Oh).  Currently, I play with Little Steel and the Pittsburgh East Roller Villains.

      <h2>Yoga</h2>
        <p> Yoga, maybe the opposite of roller derby. Sitting in a calm space and breathing. But in life we need balance. Let me tell you, we do a lot of balance in yoga! I enjoy yoga and wished to expand my knowledge I became a yoga instructor.</p>

      <h3>Training for Warriors</h3>
          <p>When I am not getting my yoga on or skating I am at the gym. I like to
          lift heavy things, then put them down. At first, I started going to the gym regularly to improve my derby still.  Cross training in any sport is important.
          Even in yoga, currently one of my fitness goals is to be able to do handstands.
          Below is  video where I almost doing to pull up! (#2 goal!).

          <P>P.s I am also a huge nerd (refer back to the degree in Biology for funzies).
            If you notice my background is Tardis blue(HEX #003D6B). You are welcome.<p>
